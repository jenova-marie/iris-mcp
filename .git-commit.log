--- Summary ---
This session refactored the MCP configuration system to use file-based configs
instead of stringified JSON, fixing a critical bug where --mcp-config flag
expected a file path but was receiving JSON strings.

Key Changes:
- Moved command-builder.ts from src/transport/ to src/utils/
- Created mcp-config-writer.ts utility for file operations
- Added 4 shell scripts (mcp-cp.sh/ps1, mcp-scp.sh/ps1)
- Updated both local and SSH transports to write config files
- Added mcpConfigScript field to IrisConfig
- Updated all tests and documentation

Architecture: Pipe-based design where TypeScript streams JSON to shell scripts
via stdin, scripts handle filesystem operations, and return file paths via stdout.
