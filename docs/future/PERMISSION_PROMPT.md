# Using SSH Port Fowarding for Remote --permission-prompt-tool

https://github.com/mmarcen/test_permission-prompt-tool

new team config thoughts
"forwardPermissions": true,
"remoteForwardingPort": 1615,  # default to Iris 1615 "IRIS"

This is some cool stuff - probably mega security concerns thoughts
Remote SSH Cladue Code could communicate back to the host Iris MCP server simply by opening a ssh remote forwarding port back to Iris MCP server herself.  Hell yeah!

to use --permission-prompt-tool I see those approvals being requested in the web app (or Slack relayed)

Box A initiates an SSH connection to Box B
Box A sets up a reverse tunnel that forwards a port on Box B back to Box A
When something on Box B connects to that local port, it gets forwarded through the SSH tunnel back to Box A

The command would be something like:
ssh -R remote_port:localhost:local_port user@boxB
This is different from regular (local) port forwarding where you forward a local port to a remote destination.
I should give a clear, practical answer with examples.Yes! Absolutely. This is called reverse SSH tunneling or remote port forwarding, and you do it with the -R flag.
The Setup
From Box A, run:
bashssh -R 8080:localhost:3000 user@boxB
This creates a tunnel where:

Port 8080 on Box B ‚Üí forwards to ‚Üí port 3000 on Box A
Any process on Box B connecting to localhost:8080 will actually be talking to the process on Box A at port 3000

Example Scenario
Box A (your laptop):
bash# Start a web server on port 3000
python -m http.server 3000
Box A (same laptop, different terminal):
bash# Create the reverse tunnel
ssh -R 8080:localhost:3000 user@boxB
Box B (the remote server):
bash# Now this fetches from Box A's web server!
curl http://localhost:8080
Useful Flags

-N - Don't execute a remote command (just forward ports)
-f - Go to background
-R 0.0.0.0:8080:localhost:3000 - Bind to all interfaces on Box B (not just localhost)

bashssh -f -N -R 8080:localhost:3000 user@boxB
Common Use Cases

Exposing a local development server to a remote environment
Allowing a remote system to access a database on your local machine
Callback webhooks when testing locally
Bypassing firewall restrictions

Note: Box B needs GatewayPorts yes in /etc/ssh/sshd_config if you want processes on Box B from other machines (not just localhost) to access the forwarded port.
Is this for a specific use case you're working on?RetryJM93605Note: Box B needs GatewayPorts yes in /etc/ssh/sshd_config if you want processes on Box B from other machines (not just localhost) to access the forwarded port." processes on Box B from other machines (not just localhost) to access the forwarded port" what does that mean?Clarified SSH port forwarding and network access mechanics.The user is asking for clarification about what "processes on Box B from other machines (not just localhost) to access the forwarded port" means.
Let me break this down:
By default, when you do -R 8080:localhost:3000, the forwarded port on Box B binds to localhost (127.0.0.1) only. This means:

Only processes running ON Box B itself can connect to that port
If there's a Box C on the network, it cannot connect to Box B's port 8080

With GatewayPorts yes, you can bind to 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces), which means:

Processes on Box B can still connect (localhost)
BUT ALSO, other machines on the network (like Box C) can connect to Box B's IP address on that port

So "processes on Box B from other machines" is a bit confusing wording. I think I meant to say "processes on OTHER machines connecting TO Box B" - i.e., processes running on Box C that want to connect to the forwarded port on Box B.
Let me clarify this more clearly.Good catch - that wording is confusing! Let me clarify:
Without GatewayPorts yes (default):
When you create the reverse tunnel, the port on Box B binds only to localhost (127.0.0.1).
Who can access it:

‚úÖ Processes running on Box B itself (connecting to localhost:8080)
‚ùå Other machines on the network (like Box C) trying to connect to Box B

Box C ‚Üí [tries to connect to BoxB:8080] ‚Üí ‚ùå BLOCKED
Box B ‚Üí [connects to localhost:8080] ‚Üí ‚úÖ Works ‚Üí forwards to Box A
```

## With `GatewayPorts yes`:

The port binds to all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`), making it accessible from the network.

**Who can access it:**
- ‚úÖ Processes running **on Box B itself**
- ‚úÖ **Other machines** (like Box C) connecting **to Box B's IP address**
```
Box C ‚Üí [connects to BoxB-IP:8080] ‚Üí ‚úÖ Works ‚Üí forwards to Box A
Box B ‚Üí [connects to localhost:8080] ‚Üí ‚úÖ Works ‚Üí forwards to Box A
Example
Without GatewayPorts:
bash# On Box C (another machine)
curl http://boxB-ip-address:8080  # ‚ùå Connection refused
With GatewayPorts:
bash# On Box C (another machine)
curl http://boxB-ip-address:8080  # ‚úÖ Success! Reaches Box A
Does that make more sense?RetryJMI'm setting GatewayPorts no - that shit is scaryValidated security concerns about GatewayPorts configuration.The user is expressing concern about the security implications of GatewayPorts yes, and has decided to keep it as "no". They're being appropriately cautious. I should validate their security concern and confirm this is the right choice for most use cases.Smart move!
Keeping GatewayPorts no is the secure default. You're essentially saying "only processes on Box B itself can use this tunnel" - which is exactly what you want in most cases.
Why it's scary:
With GatewayPorts yes, you're basically turning Box B into a public proxy to Box A. Anyone who can reach Box B on the network can now reach services on Box A that you never intended to expose. That's a huge attack surface.
You probably don't need it because:
If you need to access the tunnel from Box B, you just SSH into Box B and connect to localhost:8080 from there:
bash# From your laptop
ssh user@boxB

# Now on Box B
curl localhost:8080  # This reaches Box A through the tunnel
The tunnel works perfectly fine for processes running on Box B - which is the typical use case.
If you really need external access:
Instead of GatewayPorts yes, use SSH local forwarding chains or a proper VPN. Much safer.
Keep it locked down! üîí
